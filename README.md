# Data Science And Machine lerning Model Predicting Home Prices


In this project builded a Machine lerning Model which will predict home
prices. predicting price on factors of area, location , BHK, bathrooms. 
This project is not just about machine lerning its also about data clening. 
80% of time is spend on clening a data. and 20% of time spend on model building.  
## Primary Goal
As this is my first project in data science and machine learning my primary goal is to know how projects are in this domain and how to handle and clean the big data and build a machine learning model.




## About This Project 
In real life prices of property depends on factors like location, rooms, bathrooms, and other factors. This project is about predicting home prices based on factors like area, the number of rooms, bathrooms, and location and calculating the price of the property. 

## Learning From This Project
1. Data cleaning - In this project, 80% of the work is about cleaning the data. 
    
      1.1 Null values - In the data, cleaning checks how much of the data is having null values and how to handle them by removing null values if they are in a small quantity because overall data is not going to affect or handle by finding mean values for them. 


      1.2 Outliers - In a project I also find data where values are misleading and wrong. For example, some houses have a small area of 2300sqft but have 43 bedrooms, and some houses have more bedrooms and premium location but still have low prices per sqft. How using mean and standard deviation and some other basics formula removed all the outliers.

2. Feature Engineering - 
Feature engineering.Is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren't in the training set. 
In this project to predict the price, I included a price per sqft to know the price per sqft, and using that evaluate data in the further process helped to remove some outliers. 

3. One-hot encoding - 
The machine learning model machine doesn't know how to handle text values. It just uses numeric values. So using one-hot encoding we assign each different text a numeric value. 

4. Model Building- 
In model building, used K fold cross-validation and hyper parameter tuning to train, test the model, and find the best model which high accuracy. 

## Challenges 

1. Data Clening 
2. Critical Thinking 
3. Problem Solving Skills 
4. Questioning to Know how to clean data
